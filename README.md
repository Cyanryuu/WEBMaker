#WEBMaker - Simple GUI for .webm file creation#

####HOWTO####

1. Download and run WEBMaker.exe (Click and choose view RAW)
2. Drag and drop a video you'd like to turn into a .webm
3. Click 'Make', files are placed in the output folder


By default it turns the full video into a .webm and doesn't care about file size limits.

####"Advanced"####
* Set a start and stop time to crop a video.
* Set a file size limitation and the program automatically finds the best quality for that size. (for example 3MB on 4chan) 
* Increase the amount of threads for faster processing.
* Set a specific resolution. Setting either x or y to -1 will make it auto adjust to the other value.
* 2pass can increase the quality and sometimes it can be error prone.
