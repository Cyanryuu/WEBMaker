#WEBMaker - Simple GUI for .webm file creation
####By KFAPPER####

####WEBMAKER####
uses .NET which is installed by default on newer Windows versions
does absolutely nothing else than make .webms
is a click and point wrapper around FFMPEG

####HOWTO####

1. Download and run WEBMaker.exe (Click and choose view RAW) or get the full Zip
2. Drag and drop a video you'd like to turn into a .webm
3. Enter the start and end time for what you want to turn into a .webm
4. Choose your resoultion and bitrate
5. Click 'Make', the result is placed in the output folder
6. Upload to, for example gfycat.com and don't forget to select the "Do not resize" option

####"Tips"####
Use the miliseconds (.000)
Use more threads for faster results
Use only as much bitrate as you need, that is, a webm might look as good with 5000k bitrate as with 8000k and it will be smaller in size, therefore load faster.
